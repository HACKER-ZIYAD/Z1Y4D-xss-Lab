# XSS Lab

An interactive, self-hosted XSS training lab with 23 progressively harder challenges. Built for hackers, pentesters, and developers who want to understand cross-site scripting from the ground up.

Every level runs on a single Node.js server with zero external dependencies beyond Express. No databases, no build step. (If you want to run it in a Docker Container, Stealthcopter added a docker file!)

## Levels

| # | Name | Difficulty |
|---|------|------------|
| 1 | Hello, Reflected XSS | Easy |
| 2 | Stored XSS Guestbook | Easy |
| 3 | Script Tag Blocked | Medium |
| 4 | Attribute Injection | Medium |
| 5 | JavaScript Context | Medium |
| 6 | Event Handler Blocklist | Hard |
| 7 | Case & Keyword Filter | Hard |
| 8 | DOM-Based XSS | Hard |
| 9 | href Injection with Filters | Expert |
| 10 | CSP Bypass | Expert |
| 11 | Double Encoding Bypass | Expert |
| 12 | Client-Side Template Injection | Expert |
| 13 | postMessage XSS | Expert |
| 14 | SVG Upload XSS | Expert |
| 15 | Mutation XSS | Expert |
| 16 | Recursive Keyword Filter | Expert |
| 17 | The Polyglot | Expert |
| 18 | DOM Clobbering | Expert |
| 19 | Prototype Pollution to XSS | Expert |
| 20 | Base Tag Injection | Expert |
| 21 | Dangling Markup Injection | Expert |
| 22 | JSON Injection in Script Block | Expert |
| 23 | URL Scheme Bypass | Expert |

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArtSecTest/artsec-xss-labs.git
cd artsec-xss-labs
npm install
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Features

- **Dashboard** with progress tracking across all 23 levels
- **Hints** for every level (base64-encoded so you won't accidentally spoil yourself in page source)
- **Detailed writeups** that unlock after solving each level, explaining why the attack worked, the key lesson, and real-world applications
- **Cheat sheet** with all techniques, injection contexts, and defenses at a glance
- **Solutions saved locally** to `solutions.json` (gitignored) so your progress in the CHEATSHEET persists across restarts
- **Reset button** on the dashboard to start fresh

## How It Works

Each level presents a vulnerable web page with specific defenses. Your goal is to trigger `alert()` (or exfiltrate data, for level 21). The server deliberately implements flawed sanitization to teach you why each defense fails and what the correct fix would be.

Levels 1-8 cover fundamentals. Levels 9-17 introduce CSP bypasses, template injection, mutation XSS, and other intermediate techniques. Levels 18-23 cover advanced topics like DOM clobbering, prototype pollution, base tag injection, dangling markup, and encoding mismatches.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- A modern browser (Chrome recommended)

## Disclaimer

This project is for **educational purposes only**. The vulnerabilities are intentional and should only be exploited within this local lab environment. Do not use these techniques against systems you do not own or have explicit authorization to test.
